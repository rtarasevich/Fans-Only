Fans Only Readme

Group project with Taryn, Ryan, and Robin

Welcome to Fans Only

Fans Only is a website designed to help you find the music and gifs you love.

All you have to do is:
- type what artist you like in the search box
- click search
 and VOILÃ€!

 Results from youtube and giphy will appear at your finger tips!

 Users can use results to create playlists and discover more about the artists they already love and adore.

 We are....
 FANS ONLY!!!!!

Technologies used: 
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/
Giphy: https://giphy.com/
Tailwind: https://tailwindcss.com/

While working with the youtube API we kept running into copywrite issues. Given the resources that we have we were able to get at least a thumbnail of the video to display.
